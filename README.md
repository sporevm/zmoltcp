# zmoltcp

A pure Zig dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) TCP/IP stack for freestanding targets,
architecturally inspired by [smoltcp](https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp)
(Rust no_std).

## What This Is

zmoltcp is a standalone, zero-allocation network stack designed for bare-metal
and custom OS use. It implements full dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 networking with
comptime-parameterized generics -- zero runtime branching on address type,
dead code elimination for single-stack builds, and type safety that prevents
accidentally passing a v6 address to a v4 socket.

Supported protocols: TCP (full state machine, SACK, timestamps, Reno/Cubic),
UDP, ICMPv4/v6, ARP, NDP, IGMP, MLD, SLAAC, DHCPv4, DNS (including mDNS),
raw sockets, IPv4/IPv6 fragmentation/reassembly, IEEE 802.15.4, 6LoWPAN,
RPL, IPsec ESP/AH wire formats.

Supported mediums: Ethernet (Layer 2), raw IP (Layer 3, TUN/PPP),
IEEE 802.15.4 (constrained IoT).

zmoltcp has no kernel dependencies -- it is a pure protocol library that any
freestanding Zig project can use.

## Development Philosophy

**Make it work, make it right, make it fast** -- in that order.

**This codebase will outlive you** -- every shortcut becomes someone else's
burden. Patterns you establish will be copied. Corners you cut will be cut
again.

**Fight entropy** -- leave the codebase better than you found it.

**Inspiration vs. Recreation** -- we take inspiration from well-established
patterns (smoltcp, RFCs) and make them our own in idiomatic Zig. We do not
reinvent the wheel for the sake of it, but we also do not shy away from
unconventional approaches when they serve the design better.

## Design Principles

- **Comptime dual-stack**: Each socket, endpoint, and routing type is
  parameterized over an `Ip` type (ipv4 or ipv6). The compiler generates
  fully specialized code per IP version. No enum tag checks in the hot path.

- **Explicit poll model**: No background timers or callbacks. Call `poll()`
  with a timestamp, it tells you what to do. Your event loop owns the
  scheduling.

- **Zero allocation**: All buffers are caller-provided slices. No allocator
  interface, no hidden heap usage. Packet buffers are `[]u8` pointing into
  your DMA pool or wherever you want.

- **Stateless layers**: Wire parsing is pure: bytes in, structured data out.
  Socket state machines are explicit tagged unions -- the compiler enforces
  exhaustive handling of every TCP state.

- **Clean layer separation**: `wire/` handles parsing and serialization.
  `socket/` handles protocol state machines. `iface` routes packets. Each
  layer is independently testable.

## Building

```bash
# Run all tests (on host -- no VM, no hardware needed)
zig build test

# Cross-compile check for freestanding ARM64
zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-freestanding-none

# Build as static library (native)
zig build
```

Zig version: 0.16.0

## Testing

818 tests passing across all modules. Tests are transliterated from smoltcp's
test suite where applicable (see SPEC.md for the conformance testing
methodology and tests/CONFORMANCE.md for per-test tracking). The smoltcp
source is included as a git submodule under `ref/smoltcp/` for reference.

**Tests are diagnostic tools, not success criteria.** A passing suite does not
mean the code is good. A failing test does not mean the code is wrong. Tests
are valuable for regression detection, sanity checks, and documenting current
behavior -- but they are not a definition of correctness. The real metric is
whether the code furthers the project's vision.

```bash
# Run all unit tests
zig build test

# Run with verbose output
zig build test -- --summary all
```

## Integration Demos

Fifteen end-to-end demos exercise the full stack API (sockets -> Stack poll
loop -> Device) with no manual packet construction. They serve as both
functional validation and usage documentation.

```bash
# Run all demos
zig build demo

# Run with verbose output
zig build demo -- --summary all
```

## Using in Your Project

Add zmoltcp as a Zig dependency in your `build.zig.zon`:

```zig
.dependencies = .{
    .zmoltcp = .{
        .url = "https://github.com/hotschmoe/zmoltcp/archive/refs/tags/v<version>.tar.gz",
        .hash = "...",
    },
},
```

Then in your `build.zig`:

```zig
const zmoltcp_dep = b.dependency("zmoltcp", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});
exe.root_module.addImport("zmoltcp", zmoltcp_dep.module("zmoltcp"));
```

## Binary Size

zmoltcp's comptime generics produce smaller binaries than smoltcp's runtime
dispatch as feature count grows. Measured on `aarch64-freestanding-none` with
size-optimized settings (Zig `-OReleaseSmall`, Rust `opt-level=z` + LTO):

```
Scenario            zmoltcp   smoltcp   Ratio    .text bytes
A: TCP/IPv4          14,405    11,332    1.27x   (zmoltcp slightly larger)
B: TCP+UDP+ICMP      16,917    15,243    1.11x   (near parity)
C: Full IPv4         20,317    24,872    0.82x   (zmoltcp 18% smaller)
D: Dual-stack        27,721    43,380    0.64x   (zmoltcp 36% smaller)
E: Wire-only          1,145     5,276    0.22x   (zmoltcp 78% smaller)
TOTAL                80,505   100,103    0.80x   (zmoltcp 20% smaller overall)
```

Comptime generics break even at ~3 socket types and then progressively win.
Dual-stack is where the advantage is most pronounced: zmoltcp generates
fully specialized code per IP version, while smoltcp dispatches through
`IpRepr` enums at runtime.

Run `bash bench/size/measure.sh` to reproduce. Requires `zig`, `cargo`,
`rustup target add aarch64-unknown-none`, and `llvm-size` on PATH.

## Status

Feature-complete dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 TCP/IP stack with full smoltcp feature
parity. See `docs/20260224_plan.md` for the development plan and phase history.
